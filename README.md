# Form 8K Manager

We all news the daily financial news is lame. Born to change this
the Form8KManager will capture, parse, analyze and make sense of
and report on this event driven S.E.C. form.

Since company managers are on the hook if they fudge the facts on
this report, at least in theory, then we should have a more reliable
sense of events from the thousands of 8-K's filed annually.

Given my background as an S.E.C. reporting manager for an NYSE listed
bank in the past, including preparing many 8-K's, etc. then I
can surely do better than our local news outlets.
